# Find Bigfoot

Followed along with the Find Bigfoot project on [Hack Club's website](https://workshops.hackclub.com/find_bigfoot/) to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Browser loads a background image of a forest and an image of bigfoot. Once the bigfoot image is clicked on a pop-up box displays the text, "Woohoo, you win! You found bigfoot!". Then bigfoot randomly moves to another part of the screen where you can continue to find it, and the winning message is displayed again.
