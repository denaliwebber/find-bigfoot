# Find Bigfoot

Followed along with the Find Bigfoot project on [Hack Club's website](https://workshops.hackclub.com/find_bigfoot/) to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Browser loads a background image of a forest and an image of bigfoot. Once the bigfoot image is clicked on a pop-up box displays the text, "Woohoo, you win! You found bigfoot!". Then bigfoot randomly moves to another part of the screen where you can continue to find it, and the winning message is displayed again.
## Running
Open index.html file in a browser (I used Chrome) to start the game. Once you find bigfoot, you can continue to click on the image to move bigfoot to a new random location. You can also refresh the page and bigfoot will return to the same starting position.
